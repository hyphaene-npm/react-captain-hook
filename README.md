# Warning

/!\ this package is based on react@16.7.0-alpha.
So, it is likely to have several major releases, in case of a change in the react hooks API

# Purpose

This library is meant to expose a set of most usefull custom hooks, to let you focus on the real specific parts of your application.

It will start opiniated since I'm the only core developer, but its goal is to be as usefull as possible for the community, so feel free to open issues if your needs are not covered, to send a pull request if you've already written custom hooks that make your life easier.

# Installation

```
npm install react-custom-hook
```
or
```
yarn react-custom-hook
```

depending on which package manager you use.

# Roadmap :

- [ ] make a precise list of hooks to implement ( roadmap inception ;) )
- [ ] add typescript support


# Contribution

As said in the purpose section, feel free to send a PR or open an issue.
